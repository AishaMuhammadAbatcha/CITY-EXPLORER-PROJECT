# City Explorer - Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the City Explorer application.

## 1. Authentication Issues - FIXED âœ…

### Problem
- Authentication system would get stuck in loading state when logging back in
- Page reload after logging in would result in infinite loading without response
- Users couldn't access the dashboard after login

### Solution
The following changes were made to [src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx](src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx):

1. **Improved `signIn` function** (lines 157-177):
   - Now properly sets loading state
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Returns early on error to prevent infinite loading

2. **Enhanced `onAuthStateChange` listener** (lines 78-105):
   - Added specific handling for `SIGNED_OUT` event
   - Immediately sets loading to false when signing out
   - Better state management to prevent stuck loading states

3. **Profile fetching improvements** (lines 104-126):
   - Always sets loading to false after fetching profile, even on error
   - Prevents infinite loading if profile fetch fails

### Files Modified
- [src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx](src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)

## 3. Gemini AI Integration - COMPLETED âœ…

### Previous State
- ExploreAI chatbot used simple keyword-based mock responses
- Limited conversational ability
- No context awareness

### New Implementation

#### 1. Installed Gemini AI Package
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

#### 2. Created Gemini Service ([src/services/geminiService.ts](src/services/geminiService.ts))
A comprehensive service for interacting with Google's Gemini AI API:

**Features:**
- Uses the free tier model: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- Conversation history support for context-aware responses
- Automatic fallback to mock responses if API key is missing
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Specialized prompt for city exploration in Nigerian cities
- Optional streaming response support

**Key Methods:**
- `generateChatResponse()`: Main method for getting AI responses
- `generateStreamingChatResponse()`: For real-time streaming responses
- `getMockResponse()`: Fallback when API is unavailable

#### 3. Updated ExploreAI Component ([src/roles/individual/pages/ExploreAI.tsx](src/roles/individual/pages/ExploreAI.tsx))
- Integrated GeminiService for AI responses
- Removed old keyword-based logic
- Added conversation history tracking
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- Messages now include role information for better context

#### 4. Environment Configuration
Added Gemini API key to [.env](.env):
```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### 5. Documentation
Created [SETUP_GEMINI.md](SETUP_GEMINI.md) with:
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- API key acquisition guide
- Features overview
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting tips
- Security notes

### Benefits

- **City-Focused**: Optimized for recommending places in Nigerian cities
- **Free to Use**: Uses Gemini's free tier with generous limits
- **Fallback Support**: Works even without API key (using mock responses)

### API Limits (Free Tier)

- 1,500 requests per day
- 1 million tokens per minute

### Files Created
- [src/services/geminiService.ts](src/services/geminiService.ts) - New AI service
- [SETUP_GEMINI.md](SETUP_GEMINI.md) - Setup documentation

### Files Modified
- [src/roles/individual/pages/ExploreAI.tsx](src/roles/individual/pages/ExploreAI.tsx) - Integrated Gemini
- [.env](.env) - Added API key configuration
- [package.json](package.json) - Added @google/generative-ai dependency
