## Known Issues

1. **Notifications 404 Error**: The notifications table needs to be created in Supabase using migration 001.

2. **Google Maps Deprecation Warnings**: PlacesService is deprecated. Consider migrating to the new Place API (non-critical, still works).

3. **BusinessDeals/Reviews**: Using local state until Supabase migrations are applied.
